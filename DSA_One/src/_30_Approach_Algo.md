    Initialize an empty list, say result, to store the valid center indices.

    Calculate the length of the subarray, subarrayLength = 2 * B + 1.

    Determine the range of possible center indices. A center index i must be at least B and at most N - B - 1. So, iterate from i = B to N - B - 1.

    Inside the loop, for each potential center i, assume the subarray is alternating. Let's use a boolean flag, say isAlternating, initialized to true.

    Check the subarray from i - B to i + B. Iterate from j = i - B to i + B - 1.

    In this inner loop, check if A[j] == A[j + 1]. If this condition is true even once, it means the subarray is not alternating. Set isAlternating to false and break the inner loop.

    After the inner loop finishes, if isAlternating is still true, it means the subarray centered at i is alternating. Add i to the result list.

    After iterating through all possible center indices, return the result list. The problem states that the indices should be in sorted order, and our approach naturally generates them in this order.

The time complexity of this approach is O(NcdotB) because we have an outer loop running O(N) times and an inner loop running O(B) times. Given the constraints, this is efficient enough.
