Q2. Row Sum

Problem Description

You are given a 2D matrix A of integers.

Your task is to compute the sum of elements in each row and return a 1D array where each element represents the sum of a corresponding row in the matrix.


Problem Constraints

1 <= A.size() <= 103


1 <= A[i].size() <= 103

1 <= A[i][j] <= 103



Input Format

First argument A is a 2D array of integers.(2D matrix).


Output Format

Return an array containing row-wise sums of original matrix.


Example Input

Input 1:

[1,2,3,4]
[5,6,7,8]
[9,2,3,4]


Example Output

Output 1:

[10,26,18]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1

Row 1 = 1+2+3+4 = 10
Row 2 = 5+6+7+8 = 26
Row 3 = 9+2+3+4 = 18
